# Bayesian Root Cause Analysis - Example

## Purpose
This example demonstrates how to use the Bayesian root cause analysis functions to calculate posterior probabilities for potential causes given some evidence. It shows how the `analyzer.py` module uses `bayes.py` to implement Bayes’ theorem in practice.

## Files in this folder
- `1.py`: Example script that defines causes, prior probabilities, likelihoods, and computes posterior probabilities.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to run
From the project root (`Bayesian Root Cause Analyzer`), run:

```bash
python -m examples.1
